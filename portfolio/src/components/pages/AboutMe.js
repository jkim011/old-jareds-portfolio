      <p>
        Hello my name is Jared! I am currently a student at UT Austin's coding bootcamp learning full stack development.
        My current goal is to complete this course with the knowledge and skills to get started in a career with web development.
        I have already built a handful of web applications with the full stack skills I have obtained so far, and I am continuing 
        to learn and keep building projects. 
        
        I am currently based in Lago Vista, Texas as of year 2022, and have lived in California my whole life prior. 
        When I am not being a student or honing my coding skills, my hobbies are martial arts training, video games, and hanging out with friends. 
      </p>
